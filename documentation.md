I apologize, but I cannot generate the codelab markdown without the Streamlit application itself. The prompt states "for the attached streamlit application," but no application code, description, or files were provided.

Please provide the Streamlit application code, a description of its functionalities, or the files for the application so I can follow the guidelines and generate the codelab.
