It looks like the Streamlit application itself was not attached or provided. To generate a comprehensive codelab user guide, I need access to the application's code or at least a detailed description of its functionalities and UI.

Please provide the Streamlit application code or a clear description of its features, and I will be happy to generate the codelab following your guidelines.
